## **Description**

This is an Entity Relationship Relationship, it is the first process in the creation of what is known as a Relational database, an
extremely common practice among database developers as it allows the tables to be linked via specific relationships which link
certain values in one to to some in others.

## **Types of Relationships**

There are three main types of relationships:
* **One-to-Many**
* **One-to-One**
* **Many-to-Many** (Converted to **Conjunction**)
